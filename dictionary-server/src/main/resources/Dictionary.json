{"ass":"xzxcxz","q":"s","computer":"Any device capable of processing information to produce a desired result. No matter how large or small they are, computers typically perform their work in three well-defined steps: (1) accepting input, (2) processing the input according to predefined rules (programs), and (3) producing output. There are several ways to categorize computers, including class (ranging from microcomputers to supercomputers), generation (first through fifth generation), and mode of processing (analog versus digital). See the table. See also analog, digital (definition 2), integrated circuit, large-scale integration, very-large-scale integration.","dictionary":"A reference book containing an alphabetical list of words with information about them","asss":"sd\n\nxzc"}
